        # In the past, view and controller paths of Solidus extensions were
        # added at extension loading time. As a result, if an extension
        # customizing a Solidus engine is loaded before that engine
        # (for example, the extension is declared before the `solidus_frontend`
        # engine in the `Gemfile`), then the extension's paths for that Solidus
        # engine wouldn't be loaded.

        # The initializer below runs before `initialize_cache` because
        # `initialize_cache` runs 1) after the Solidus engines have already
        # loaded BUT 2) before Rails has added the paths to `$LOAD_PATH`.
        # Normally, it would be sufficient to run the initializer below before
        # the `set_load_path` initializer. However, external gems such as
        # Deface may also change the load paths immediately before
        # `set_load_path`. To ensure that our extension paths are not affected
        # by those gems, we work around those gems by adding our paths before
        # `initialize_cache`, which is the Rails initializer called before
        # `set_load_path`.
