# SolidusSupport

This gem contains common runtime functionality for Solidus extensions.

If you are looking for development tools instead, see
[solidus_dev_support](https://github.com/solidusio-contrib/solidus_dev_support).

## Usage

### `SolidusSupport::Migration`

Rails >= 5 introduced the concept of specifying what Rails version your migration was written for,
like `ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]`. Not specifying a version is deprecated in Rails 5.0 and removed
in Rails 5.1. This wasn't backported to Rails 4.2, so we provide this helper to return the right
parent class:

``` ruby
# On Rails 4.2
SolidusSupport::Migration[4.2] # returns `ActiveRecord::Migration`
SolidusSupport::Migration[5.0] # errors

# On Rails 5.0
SolidusSupport::Migration[4.2] # same as `ActiveRecord::Migration[4.2]`
SolidusSupport::Migration[5.0] # same as `ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]`
```

There's no reason to use `SolidusSupport::Migration[5.0]` over `ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]`, but
it is provided.

### Engine extensions

This extension provides a module that decorates `Rails::Engine` to seamlessly support autoloading
decorators both with the classic autoloader and with Zeitwerk on Rails 6. In order to use it, just
include the provided module in your `Engine` class:

```ruby
module SolidusExtensionName
  class Engine < Rails::Engine
    engine_name 'solidus_extension_name'

    include SolidusSupport::EngineExtensions

    # ...
  end
end
```

If needed, also ensure to remove the original implementation of `.activate`:

```ruby
def self.activate
  Dir.glob(File.join(root, "app/**/*_decorator*.rb")) do |c|
    Rails.configuration.cache_classes ? require(c) : load(c)
  end
end

config.to_prepare(&method(:activate).to_proc)
```

#### Loading files conditionally

If you include `EngineExtensions` in your extension and structure your files according to the
expected paths, they will be loaded automagically only when the relevant Solidus engines are
available.

Here's what an example structure may look like:

- `lib/views/backend`: will only be added to the view paths when `solidus_backend` is available.
- `lib/controllers/backend`: will only be added to the controller paths when `solidus_backend` is
  available.
- `lib/decorators/backend`: will only be added to the decorator paths when `solidus_backend` is
  available.

The same goes for `frontend` and `api`.

We strongly recommend following this structure and making your extensions so that they're not
dependent on anything other than `solidus_core`, only augmenting the functionality of the other
engines when they are available.

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new
version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which
will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
