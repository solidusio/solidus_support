# SolidusSupport

This gem holds some common functionality for Solidus Extensions.

It has some utilities to make it easier to support multiple versions of Solidus.

## Usage

### `SolidusSupport::Migration`

Rails >= 5 introduced the concept of specifying what rails version your migration was written for, like `ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]`.
Not specifying a version is deprecated in Rails 5.0 and removed in rails 5.1.
This wasn't backported to Rails 4.2, but Rails 4.2 _is_ Rails 4.2. So we provide this helper.

``` ruby
# On Rails 4.2
SolidusSupport::Migration[4.2] # returns `ActiveRecord::Migration`
SolidusSupport::Migration[5.0] # errors

# On Rails 5.0
SolidusSupport::Migration[4.2] # same as `ActiveRecord::Migration[4.2]`
SolidusSupport::Migration[5.0] # same as `ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]`
```

There's no reason to use `SolidusSupport::Migration[5.0]` over `ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]`, but it is provided.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
